# Automatic-Segmentation-of-Aortic-and-Mitral-Valves-for-Heart-Surgical-Planning-of-HOCM
Dataset

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. 
Septal myectomy surgery has been recognized as the gold standard for non-pharmacological therapy of HOCM, in which aortic and mitral valves are critical regions for surgical planning.
Currently, manual segmentation of aortic and mitral valves is widely performed in clinical practice to construct 3D models used for HOCM surgical planning. 
Such a process, however, is time-consuming and costly. 

Our dataset consists of 27 3D CT images captured by a Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash machine. The ages of the associated patients range from 38 to 76 years with an average
of 57.6 years. The size of the images is 512 × 512×(275−571), and the typical voxel size is 0.25×0.25×0.5mm3. The annotations were performed by two experienced radiologists, and
the time for labeling each image is 0.5-1.5 hours. The labels include seven substructures: AV, MV, AO, LA, LV, myocardium, and excised myocardium.
